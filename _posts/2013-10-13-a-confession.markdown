A Confession
=========================================
13/10/2013
-----------------------------------------

At the time of writing, there is a wildfire in the Ruby community; another
high profile drama has been revealed and once again threatens to tear us apart.
The "TL;DR;" is that a prominent previously respected member of the community
allegedly committed an atrocity against a friend of theirs, a co-worker no less.

Once again this had drawn out the questions of sexism and privilege within our
community, much to the hatred of those who benefit from it. As usual we see
those who are blameless attract so much hate, and the perpetrator get away with
oh so much.

Again our culture is drawn into question, particularly that of our conferences
which have developed an almost unhealthy obsession with alcohol fueled parties
along side, part of the hacker, startup, brogrammer ethos we seem to have
accidentally groomed to be a part of our community.

#So... a confession.

**I'm a privileged programmer.**

I'm white, male, had the good fortune to attend a decent university and now reap
the benefits. I have a decent income and generally enjoy what I get to do. That's
something that happens only for the lucky few in this world.

I enjoy attending conferences, swapping ideas and collaborating with friends and
developers from across the world. I enjoy the parties, allowing me to unwind and
socialise in what'd otherwise be an awkward social situation for me. Hell I've
even drunk too much at those parties, something I am eternally scared and
ashamed of.

But despite that... I am horrified by the events that have unfolded, even more so
by **how** they have unfolded, with our communal morbid curiosity forcing the victim
to reveal all the gory details of the night in question. For what? To top it all
off we then see outpourings of hate, not against the perpetrator but against the
victim.

What happened to MINSWAN?

What's more concerning to me, as one of the privileged, I have no clue how to fix
this.

How can we stop these sorts of events happening whilst not destroying our
culture in the process? Nobody wants the Ruby or any community to be a soulless
corporate experience, but we obviously need to reign in some of our more outlandish
tendencies.

How can we be more inclusive, make everybody feel safe, welcome and build a better
world?

Help...
