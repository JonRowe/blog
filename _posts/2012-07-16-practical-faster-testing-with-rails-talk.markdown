Practical Faster Testing With Rails
=========================================
Talk @ Scottish Ruby Conference Fringe 1/7/2012
-----------------------------------------

At the end of June I was able to attend the fantastic Scottish Ruby
Conference up in sunny Edinburgh. After a fun packed and informative
weekend involving copious whiskey and brilliant talks from some well
educated rubyists you'd have though we would be all worn out come
sunday.

Not so it seems and so the SRC Fringe was born. Organised by one
[@ryanstenhouse](http://twitter.com/ryanstenhouse) and taking place
over a few gentle hours on sunday afternoon. The Fringe event made for
a nice ending to a exhausting weekend.

I was lucky enough to give a talk, it was about Practical Faster Testing
with Rails and I would love your feedback. You can find it in the usual
places, [(on Vimeo)]( http://vimeo.com/45474361 )
[(on Speakerdeck)]( https://speakerdeck.com/u/jonrowe/p/practical-faster-testing-with-rails )
or for your convenience it is embdedded below.
