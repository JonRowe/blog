Practical Faster Testing With Rails
=========================================
Talk @ Scottish Ruby Conference Fringe 1/7/2012
-----------------------------------------

At the end of June I was able to attend the fantastic Scottish Ruby
Conference up in Edinburgh. After the usual fun packed and informative
couple of days you'd have though we would be all worn out come sunday.
Not so it seems and so the SRC Fringe was born.

Organised by one [@ryanstenhouse](http://twitter.com/ryanstenhouse) and
taking place over a few gentle hours on sunday afternoon. The Fringe event
made for a nice ending to a exhausting weekend.

I was lucky enough to give a talk, it was about Practical Faster Testing
with Rails and I would love your feedback.

You can find it in the usual places, [(on Vimeo)]( http://vimeo.com/45474361 )
